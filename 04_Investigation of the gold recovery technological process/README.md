## Investigation of the gold recovery technological process

#### Task: 
Predict the concentration of gold in the gold refining process.

#### Description:
A machine learning model is being built to predict the recovery rate of gold from gold-bearing ore based on data with mining and refining parameters. The model will help optimise production to avoid running a plant with unprofitable characteristics.

#### Tools and Skills applied:
*Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy, Exploratory Data Analysis*
