## Predicting the Bank's customer churn

#### Task: 
Based on the data from the bank, we need to identify a customer who may leave.

#### Description:
Customers are leaving the bank. It is cheaper to retain existing customers than to attract new ones. We need to predict whether a client will leave the bank in the near future or not. Historical data on customer behaviour and termination of contracts with the bank are provided.

#### Tools and Skills applied:
*Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib*
