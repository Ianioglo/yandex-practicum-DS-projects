#### Task: 
Determining age from a photo.

#### Description:
A chain supermarket is introducing a computer vision system to process customer photos. Photo-fixing in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to analyse purchases and offer products that might appeal to customers in that age group and monitor cashiers' integrity when selling alcohol. A model is being built that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. We have a set of photos of people with an indication of their age..
