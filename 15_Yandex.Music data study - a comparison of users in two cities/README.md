## Yandex.Music data study - a comparison of users in two cities

#### Task: 
Using real data from Yandex.Music with the help of Pandas library and its capabilities to check the data and compare the behaviour and preferences of users of the two cities - Moscow and St. Petersburg.

#### Description:
The comparison between Moscow and St Petersburg is surrounded by myths:
- Moscow is a megalopolis subject to the rigours of the working week;
- St Petersburg is a city of peculiar culture, unlike Moscow.
Some myths reflect reality. Others are empty stereotypes. Businesses must distinguish the former from the latter in order to make rational decisions. Using real data from Yandex.Music, we will check the data and compare the behaviour of users of the two capitals.

#### Tools and Skills applied:
*Python, Pandas, Data Preprocessing*
