- ### Machine learning
| Project Name | Project Description | Tools and Skills applied | 
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [Predicting customer churn](big_cities_music) | Telecom operator wants to study how to predict customer churn. If it turns out that a user is planning to leave, they will be offered promo codes and special terms. The operator's team has collected personal data on some customers, information about their tariffs and contracts.| *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, LightGBM, Catboost* |
| [Forecasting the number of taxi orders for the next hour](big_cities_music) | A taxi company has compiled historical data on taxi bookings at airports. In order to attract more drivers at peak times, it needs to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. A model is being built to make this prediction.| *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, StatsModels* |
| [Building a model for determining the car's price](big_cities_music) | A used-cars sales service is developing an app to attract new customers. The app allows to quickly find out the market value of your car. A model must be built based on historical data to determine the car's value.| *Python, Pandas, LightGBM* |
| [Investigation of the gold recovery technological process](big_cities_music) | A machine learning model is being built to predict the recovery rate of gold from gold-bearing ore based on data with mining and refining parameters. The model will help optimise production to avoid running a plant with unprofitable characteristics.| *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy* |
| [Identifying the most profitable oil production region](big_cities_music) | There are oil samples in three regions. The characteristics of each well in the region are already known. A model needs to be built to determine the region where production is most profitable. | *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy, Bootstrap* |
| [Predicting the Bank's customer churn](big_cities_music) | Customers are leaving the bank. It is cheaper to retain existing customers than to attract new ones. We need to predict whether a client will leave the bank in the near future or not. Historical data on customer behaviour and termination of contracts with the bank are provided. | *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib* |
| [Classification of telecom company customers](big_cities_music) | A mobile operator has found out: many customers use archived tariffs. The mobile operator wants to build a system that can analyse customers behaviour and offer users one of the new tariffs. | *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib* |
