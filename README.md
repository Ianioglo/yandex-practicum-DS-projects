### Machine Learning
| Project Name | Project Description | Tools and Skills applied | 
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [Predicting the Telecom company's customer churn](big_cities_music) | Telecom operator wants to study how to predict customer churn. If it turns out that a user is planning to leave, they will be offered promo codes and special terms. The operator's team has collected personal data on some customers, information about their tariffs and contracts.| *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, LightGBM, Catboost* |
| [Forecasting the number of taxi orders for the next hour](big_cities_music) | A taxi company has compiled historical data on taxi bookings at airports. In order to attract more drivers at peak times, it needs to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. A model is being built to make this prediction.| *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, StatsModels* |
| [Building a model for determining the car's price](big_cities_music) | A used-cars sales service is developing an app to attract new customers. The app allows to quickly find out the market value of your car. A model must be built based on historical data to determine the car's value.| *Python, Pandas, LightGBM* |
| [Investigation of the gold recovery technological process](big_cities_music) | A machine learning model is being built to predict the recovery rate of gold from gold-bearing ore based on data with mining and refining parameters. The model will help optimise production to avoid running a plant with unprofitable characteristics.| *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy* |
| [Identifying the most profitable oil production region](big_cities_music) | There are oil samples in three regions. The characteristics of each well in the region are already known. A model needs to be built to determine the region where production is most profitable. | *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy, Bootstrap* |
| [Predicting the Bank's customer churn](big_cities_music) | Customers are leaving the bank. It is cheaper to retain existing customers than to attract new ones. We need to predict whether a client will leave the bank in the near future or not. Historical data on customer behaviour and termination of contracts with the bank are provided. | *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib* |
| [Classification of telecom company customers](big_cities_music) | A mobile operator has found out: many customers use archived tariffs. The mobile operator wants to build a system that can analyse customers behaviour and offer users one of the new tariffs. | *Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib* |

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
| Project Name | Project Description | Tools and Skills applied | 
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [Model learning to classify toxic comments](big_cities_music) | The online shop is launching a new service. Users can now edit and add to product descriptions, just like in wiki communities. That is, customers propose their own edits and comment on the changes of others. A tool is required which will search for toxic comments and send them for moderation.| *Python, Pandas, NLTK, BERT, TF-IDF* |

### Computer Vision
| Project Name | Project Description | Tools and Skills applied | 
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [Determining age by photo](big_cities_music) | A chain supermarket is introducing a computer vision system to process customer photos. You need to build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photo.| *Python, Pandas, Keras* |

### Data Encryption
| Project Name | Project Description | Tools and Skills applied | 
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [Protection of insurance company customer data](big_cities_music) | Developing a model for anonymising the personal data of an insurance company's customers. Elaborating a data transformation method that makes it difficult to retrieve personal customer information.| *Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn* |

### Data Analysis and Visualization
| Project Name | Project Description | Tools and Skills applied | 
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [Identifying the patterns and factors that facilitate the success of computer games](big_cities_music) | Using historical data on sales of computer games, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms it's required to carry out the computer games market research and identify the patterns and factors that lead to the success of a particular game.| *Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Data Preprocessing, EDA, Statistical Hypothesis Testing* |
| [Defining the best profitable tariff for a telecom company](big_cities_music) | A preliminary analysis of tariff usage on a sample of customers needs to be carried out, the behaviour of customers in using the operator's services is to be analysed and the optimal sets of services for users are supposed to be recommended. | *Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Data Preprocessing, EDA, Statistical Hypothesis Testing* |
| [Flats for sale in St Petersburg - Real estate market analysis](big_cities_music) | Using data from the Real Estate Service, it is necessary to determine the market value of the properties and the typical parameters of the flats. | *Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Data Preprocessing, EDA, Data Visualization* |
| [The Bank's borrower reliability study](big_cities_music) | Using creditworthiness statistics, investigate whether the client's marital status and number of children affects whether the loan is repaid on time. | *Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Data Preprocessing* |
| [Yandex.Music data study - a comparison of users in two cities](big_cities_music) | Using real data from Yandex.Music with the help of Pandas library and its capabilities to check the data and compare the behaviour and preferences of users of the two cities - Moscow and St. Petersburg. | *Python, Pandas, Data Preprocessing* |
